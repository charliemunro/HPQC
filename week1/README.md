Week 1: Accessing HPC Resources and GitHub Setup

Discussion

Overview

This week focused on setting up access to the HPC cluster (Cheetah) and configuring GitHub for version control. These steps are essential for high-performance computing and collaborative development.

Accessing HPC Resources

1. Connecting to the HPC Cluster

Used SSH to connect to Frank and then to Cheetah.

Verified access to MPI commands by checking mpicc and mpiexec.

2. Importance of Remote Access

Accessing the cluster enables the execution of computational workloads from any location.

SSH provides secure access to shared computing resources.

GitHub Setup

1. Creating and Cloning a Repository

A repository named HPQC was created on GitHub.

The repository was cloned to the HPC environment.

2. Using Git for Version Control

Basic Git commands (add, commit, push, pull) were practiced.

A structured folder system was established to organize code by weeks.
